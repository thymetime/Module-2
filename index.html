                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                        the industry's
                        standard
                        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
                        to make a type
                        specimen
                        book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                        remaining essentially
                        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
                        Ipsum passages, and
                        more
                        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                        Ipsum.

                        Shrek 2 is a 2004 American animated fantasy comedy film loosely based on the 1990 children's
                        picture book Shrek! by
                        William Steig. Directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury, and Conrad Vernon (in Vernon's feature
                        directorial debut) from
                        a screenplay by Adamson, Joe Stillman, and the writing team of J. David Stem and David N. Weiss,
                        it is the sequel to
                        Shrek (2001) and the second installment in the Shrek film series. The film stars Mike Myers,
                        Eddie Murphy and Cameron
                        Diaz, who reprise their respective voice roles of Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona. They are
                        joined by new characters
                        voiced by Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett, and Jennifer Saunders.
                        Shrek 2 takes place
                        following the events of the first film, with Shrek and Donkey meeting Fiona's parents as the
                        zealous Fairy Godmother,
                        who wants Fiona to marry her son Prince Charming, plots to destroy Shrek and Fiona's marriage.
                        Shrek and Donkey team up
                        with a sword-wielding cat named Puss in Boots to foil her plans.
